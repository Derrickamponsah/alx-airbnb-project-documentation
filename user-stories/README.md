# User Stories Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains **user stories** derived from the Use Case Diagram for the **Airbnb Clone Backend Project**.  
User stories describe system functionality from the end-user’s perspective and serve as the foundation for backlog creation, sprint planning, and development.

## Files
- **user-stories.md** → Contains the detailed user stories for Guests, Hosts, Admins, and integration with external services like payment gateways.

## Purpose
- Ensure all stakeholders understand system requirements.
- Provide a clear, user-centered guide for developers and testers.
- Serve as the basis for converting requirements into agile backlog items.

## Next Steps
- Break down these user stories into smaller, testable **tasks** during sprint planning.
- Prioritize stories based on business value (MVP features like registration, booking, and payments should come first).
